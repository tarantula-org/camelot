## Mission

**"C is legacy."** We reject this statement.

The problem isn't the language; it is the **Standard Library**. Camelot bridges the gap by bringing modern systems engineering concepts into the raw power of C:

1.  **Workspaces, not Malloc:** Memory is managed in scopes (Arenas), not individual pointers.
2.  **Views, not Copies:** Data is immutable and shared by default.
3.  **Transparency:** No hidden allocations. No magic.

## Getting Started

We provide a comprehensive guide to get you from zero to a running kernel in 30 seconds.

## Manifesto

**"Why still use C?"**

It is the industry's favorite question. The answer is not nostalgia; it is architectural necessity. We have compiled a comprehensive technical defense of C, dismantling the "Legacy" myth with architectural proofs.

## Roadmap

We follow a strict, layered architectural progression (Epochs).
